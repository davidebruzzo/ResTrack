## Introduction <a name="Paragraph1"></a>
-----------------------------

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names. 

When done, you can run the program with:

```bash
$ python run.py assignment.py
```

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].
