## Introduction <a name="Paragraph1"></a>
-----------------------------
Here some informations about the Robot.

### Installing and running 
 
The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/), [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).
Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the `test.py` script to test out the simulator.

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names.
When done, you can run the program with:

```bash
$ python run.py assignment.py
```

###Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].
